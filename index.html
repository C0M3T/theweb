		<p>My first hobby that is technically also a class is photography.I take fifty photos a week about a certain thing every week. At first I only joined photography because my parents told me that I take really good photos so I wanted to try it out. At first I thought that fifty a week was to much but a the weeks went on I realised that fifty is just a number. And focus pays off.</p>

		<p>My second hobby is playing volleyball and soccer. I played soccer last year for my school team but not this year. I dedided not to play this year cause I wanted to catch up with all my grades. I tried something new this year called volleyball. At first I always thought that volleyball was boring because I only played at PE and everyone sucks. But when I actually played it with a team that could pass and hit, the sport became my favorite sport. Now I cant wait till the season start again.

		<p>My last hobby is playing video games. I play all types off games I play nba,fifa black op,infinite and some more. I have a ps4. I play video games cause I find them fun and entertaining. But its not just the games, its also the people I play the games with. I have a group of people that I play with, which I dont know in real life btw and Ive played with them for 3 years. And I can only play on the weekends and friday. Because of these three reasons combined, the fisrt thing I do when I come home is go on my ps4.</p>
