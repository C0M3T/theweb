		<p>The day before camp we taked about what we had to do 
		 which was,putting our pictures on slack,starting to do our
		 journals and to finish writing about the entrepreur that 
		 impactted the world by tech. We also talked about our website and
		 how we needed to follow robs steps he gave us to get our
		 link so that everyone can see it. Then with the little 
		 time we had we talked about last minute things we needed
		 for camp such as shower shoes and to bring something special. </p>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;color: white">6-14-17</h3>
		<p>This was the first day of camp. We got there around 12:00 pm,
		 we ate an amazing lunch(hamburgers).We then did an activity called
		 the knot game. The knot game was a real struggle when it came t our
		 group. We took a long time to unravel. We didnt communicate or 
		 listen to one another. What I learned from the other teams is that
		 other talked a lot more then us. later on we managed to talk and 
		 successfully completed the activity. At night we started to do two big
		 groups. And both groups put finshed in under 5 minutes. I also learned
		 the more you try the better you get on the certain thing. </p>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;color: white">6-15-17</h3>
		<p>The second day of camp was a long day. I took a short shower. I woke
		 up at 4:30 and that so early for me. I learned that we had to work 
		 together and stick together. Oscar gave us to tips. The two tips were to
		 always be on time. And the second  one was if he hears,thinks,or sees 
		 that your being rude to one of the coaches you are going to regret it.
		 If you don't agree with their actions then talk to Oscar or Freddy
		 The only once you can talk back to is Oscar and Freddy. If you don't 
		 agree with their actions then talk to Oscar or Freddy. Strongly suggest
		 you dont.   
 		<h3 style="text-align: center;color: white">6-16-17</h3>
 		<p>The third day of camp was a fun day. We started a challenge called the
 		 lava challenge. The lava challenge required a lot of thinking. You have
 		 to think out side the box. Everyone including the txters and seals told us that we had to work together and that we had to think outside the box. At first we didnt listen to them we were just stuck in our own world. But after we started to fail again and again we relised that we had to ask questions. Although our team was google, at the end we managed to finish and we all were proud to finish even though it took us forever. We learn a valuable lesson on that day. We learned that we need to ask our peer or people that know about that certain thing for help. The strategy we ended up being two new,one old and one new, then two new And two old and so on. </p>
 		 <h3 style="text-align: center;color: white">6-17-17</h3>
 		 <p>THe Last full day that we had was really great. After we finished the lava game we worked on the sticks game. The sticks game weas my favorite because we waited and got to see everyone find the answer. My experience with the sticks game was that I was to intuned with the sticks and didnt think about anything else. Alex and Christian B(the txters) really tried to help us by telling us to think outside the box and to look at the surroundings. When people started getting the answer I was really disappointed in myself. I was also angry that I couldnt find out the solution. But when I finally saw what was happening everythings was just rushing through my head. I felt so happy and mad that it took me so long when it was right in front of my nose. </p>

 		 <p>On sunday we had breakfast. And we didnt have to do much. We were trying to take the oerfect picture so we took a while on that. But the little speeches about us we got  before recieving our shirts because it helped us figure out our strengths and weaknesses and it helped us understand how we have improved, got better and that we came out of our comfort zone. After all that we got in line to go to the bus and to say good bye to tne lovely camp we were lucky to live in for a few days. Inside I was sleeping almost the whole time. All the little sleep that I got in the last couple of days I got back in that ride back. When I woke up I realized how fun camp really was. And how that Im proud to say that this camping experiece was the best camping exprience I have had. Even though it was my one and only.  </p>

 		 <p>On Wednesday was the first day back from camp. I didnt know what to expect. We did some activities and learned a lot. One thing we learned that day was everyone has there strengths and weaknesses and that everyone that is one your team has a special role and they all bring something to the table. This was shown to us when Valentino was talking about basketball and how you play the game, specially defense. One of the quotes that he said was "if the team on defense isnt communicating then they arent a good defensive team". This is just telling us that when we get in groups or even now that we have to communicate with each other. We also taked about the four roles and what they are but didn't go to much into detail. </p> 		
 		 <h3 style="text-align: center;color: white">6-22-17</h3>
 		 <p>Thursday was a very interesting day. We had our first guest speaker and most of us if not all of us can relate with hime didnt come from a rich background, he worked on the field was one of seven kids in the family. His name was Arnold, he thought us that you always have someone that has it worst, so u cant make excuses. And he also told us that change is a good thing. Without change you arent seeing self improvement, you are just doing the same thing again and again. Arnold also told us that success isnt just up hill, you take chances and risks so you might hit some rough spots but that doessnt mean that you give up. He told us about stocks and share holders and more. The thing he said that stuck with me was that "winners can be losers if they dont know how to play the game". That means life is a game an you have to try your best to win the game therefore win at life.  </p>
 		 <h3 style="text-align: center;color: white">6-23-17</h3>
 		 <p>On friday we learned we had rapid fire about what was going Arnold talked about. And we went in great detail on what all 4 positions are.The four positions are Project manager,Product manager, UX designer, and also Developer. We got to choose whatbrole we wanted and are best suited for. And for me I was having a hard time choosing from developer or UX designing. I didnt have experience but I feel like I would like to do either or but I decided on UX designing because Im a beginner to code so I dont see myself understanding everything that has to do with code. For UX I have done some photoshops for a class but that is pretty much it. Then we learned about something called design thinking. Design thinking is a methodology used by designers to solve complex problems, and find desirable soltions for users. And we went more in detail on that and talked about the five steps with were Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Iterate.</p>

 		 <p> Today I was told to talk about why I didnt talk to my group about how I didnt think that our problem statement about overweight young adults wasnt unique. I went with it because at the time I agreed with it. We all agreed that it was the best idea we can come up with but now when we went over it with everyone else I noticed that everyoone is doing overweight people and helping them so its not unique so we need to think a lot deeper and something so new, something so different that when we think of it we will all agree and we will all know that what we came up with the best idea.</p>
